        <h1>Best Books I Have Ever Read</h1>
        <h2>Since I was very young, my dad never objected to buying a great book. He could say “no” to get some candies or Hotwheels, but he never said “no” to a book. He encouraged me to dive into books and let them teach me about life. Little I knew that these books would impact the way I see myself and my surroundings, configuring the way I behave and analyze complex situations. From Latin American literature to self-help books, this is the compilation I will always recommend reading.</h2>
