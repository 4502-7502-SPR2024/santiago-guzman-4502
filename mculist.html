        <h1>Best MCU Movies</h1>
        <h2>This past month I have been watching againg the Marvel Ciinematic Universe again. It surprises me how well conected and how compelling the story was. I always get excited when I watch one of these movies again and I find a new relation between stories or I understand specific references. Stan Lee did an awesome job at merging all these stories together and uniting them in Infinity War and End Game. This has been the only movies I have gone to a premier and I can't compare the feeling of watching these movies for the first time with life-long fans with any other movies I have seen.</h2>

                    <p><strong>Phase:</strong> 1</p>
                    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Jon Favreau</p>
                    <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Altough Whiplash was not the most advanced villian in the list, the character growth of Tony Stark was incredible, I think this development has been one of the most important ones in the storyline since he acknowledged that his dad set him up for a better purpose than just being a millionare. I loved the relation that grew with Pepper as well and the relation with War Machine.</p>
